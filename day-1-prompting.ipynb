    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## New for Gemini 2.0!\n",
    "\n",
    "This course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n",
    "* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n",
    "  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n",
    "* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n",
    "* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output)."

      "Okay, Jash, let's talk about liquid financial investments. Here's a breakdown of what they are, their characteristics, some examples, and a few pros and cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are Liquid Financial Investments?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, a liquid investment is an asset that can be easily and quickly converted into cash with minimal loss of value.  Think of it as being able to access your money with little to no fuss when you need it. The opposite of a liquid asset is an *illiquid* asset, which is difficult to sell quickly without taking a significant price cut (like real estate, for example).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ease of Conversion:** The primary defining factor is how quickly you can turn the investment into cash.\n",
      "*   **Minimal Loss of Value:** Ideally, you want to sell the investment at or close to its fair market value.  A large price discount to sell quickly diminishes its liquidity.\n",
      "*   **Active Market:**  Liquid investments are typically traded on active, well-established markets.  This ensures there are readily available buyers.\n",
      "*   **Standardized:**  Often, the investment is standardized, making it easier to value and trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cash:** This is the most liquid asset.\n",
      "*   **Money Market Accounts (MMAs):** Savings accounts that typically offer slightly higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, with limited check-writing abilities.\n",
      "*   **Certificates of Deposit (CDs) with short maturities:**  CDs are time deposits, but those with short terms (e.g., 3 months, 6 months) are considered fairly liquid, although you usually incur a penalty for early withdrawal.\n",
      "*   **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):** Short-term debt obligations backed by the U.S. government, considered very safe and highly liquid.\n",
      "*   **Stocks (shares) of publicly traded companies:**  Especially those of large, well-known companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft). They are actively traded on major stock exchanges.\n",
      "*   **Bonds (Corporate and Government) with high trading volume:** Bonds issued by large corporations or governments that are frequently traded on the secondary market.\n",
      "*   **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):**  ETFs that track broad market indexes (e.g., S&P 500) or specific sectors are generally very liquid.\n",
      "*   **Mutual Funds (certain types):** Some mutual funds are more liquid than others, but many allow you to redeem shares daily.  The liquidity depends on the underlying assets of the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accessibility:** Easy access to your funds when needed for emergencies, opportunities, or unexpected expenses.\n",
      "*   **Flexibility:** You can quickly adjust your investment portfolio based on market conditions or your changing financial goals.\n",
      "*   **Peace of Mind:**  Knowing you can readily access your money provides a sense of security.\n",
      "*   **Opportunity to capitalize on market fluctuations:** Buy low and sell high because you can get in and out easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Lower Potential Returns:**  Generally, more liquid investments offer lower returns compared to less liquid investments (like real estate or private equity) because investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the convenience of liquidity.\n",
      "*   **Inflation Risk:** If the returns on your liquid investments are lower than the inflation rate, the purchasing power of your money can decrease over time.\n",
      "*   **Transaction Costs:** Frequent buying and selling of liquid assets (like stocks) can incur transaction costs (brokerage fees, commissions), which can eat into your returns.\n",
      "*   **Temptation to Spend:**  Easy access to funds can lead to impulsive spending decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Investment Goals:**  Your investment goals (e.g., retirement, short-term savings) will influence the appropriate level of liquidity in your portfolio.\n",
      "*   **Risk Tolerance:**  Liquid investments can range from very safe (e.g., T-Bills) to more risky (e.g., stocks).  Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance.\n",
      "*   **Time Horizon:**  If you have a long time horizon, you can generally tolerate less liquidity in your portfolio.\n",
      "*   **Diversification:**  It's generally a good idea to diversify your investments across different asset classes, including both liquid and illiquid assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Liquid financial investments are a crucial part of a well-rounded financial plan. They provide easy access to cash when needed, but it's important to balance liquidity with the potential for higher returns.  Consider your individual circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance when determining the right mix of liquid and illiquid assets for your portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any specific questions about any of these types of liquid investments, or would you like to explore any of these points in more detail? For example, are you wondering about the liquidity of a specific stock, or how to decide how much of your portfolio should be in liquid assets?\n",

       "Okay, Jash, let's talk about liquid financial investments. Here's a breakdown of what they are, their characteristics, some examples, and a few pros and cons:\n",
       "\n",
       "**What are Liquid Financial Investments?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Essentially, a liquid investment is an asset that can be easily and quickly converted into cash with minimal loss of value.  Think of it as being able to access your money with little to no fuss when you need it. The opposite of a liquid asset is an *illiquid* asset, which is difficult to sell quickly without taking a significant price cut (like real estate, for example).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Ease of Conversion:** The primary defining factor is how quickly you can turn the investment into cash.\n",
       "*   **Minimal Loss of Value:** Ideally, you want to sell the investment at or close to its fair market value.  A large price discount to sell quickly diminishes its liquidity.\n",
       "*   **Active Market:**  Liquid investments are typically traded on active, well-established markets.  This ensures there are readily available buyers.\n",
       "*   **Standardized:**  Often, the investment is standardized, making it easier to value and trade.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Examples of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Cash:** This is the most liquid asset.\n",
       "*   **Money Market Accounts (MMAs):** Savings accounts that typically offer slightly higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, with limited check-writing abilities.\n",
       "*   **Certificates of Deposit (CDs) with short maturities:**  CDs are time deposits, but those with short terms (e.g., 3 months, 6 months) are considered fairly liquid, although you usually incur a penalty for early withdrawal.\n",
       "*   **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):** Short-term debt obligations backed by the U.S. government, considered very safe and highly liquid.\n",
       "*   **Stocks (shares) of publicly traded companies:**  Especially those of large, well-known companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft). They are actively traded on major stock exchanges.\n",
       "*   **Bonds (Corporate and Government) with high trading volume:** Bonds issued by large corporations or governments that are frequently traded on the secondary market.\n",
       "*   **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):**  ETFs that track broad market indexes (e.g., S&P 500) or specific sectors are generally very liquid.\n",
       "*   **Mutual Funds (certain types):** Some mutual funds are more liquid than others, but many allow you to redeem shares daily.  The liquidity depends on the underlying assets of the fund.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pros of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Accessibility:** Easy access to your funds when needed for emergencies, opportunities, or unexpected expenses.\n",
       "*   **Flexibility:** You can quickly adjust your investment portfolio based on market conditions or your changing financial goals.\n",
       "*   **Peace of Mind:**  Knowing you can readily access your money provides a sense of security.\n",
       "*   **Opportunity to capitalize on market fluctuations:** Buy low and sell high because you can get in and out easily.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cons of Liquid Financial Investments:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lower Potential Returns:**  Generally, more liquid investments offer lower returns compared to less liquid investments (like real estate or private equity) because investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the convenience of liquidity.\n",
       "*   **Inflation Risk:** If the returns on your liquid investments are lower than the inflation rate, the purchasing power of your money can decrease over time.\n",
       "*   **Transaction Costs:** Frequent buying and selling of liquid assets (like stocks) can incur transaction costs (brokerage fees, commissions), which can eat into your returns.\n",
       "*   **Temptation to Spend:**  Easy access to funds can lead to impulsive spending decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Investment Goals:**  Your investment goals (e.g., retirement, short-term savings) will influence the appropriate level of liquidity in your portfolio.\n",
       "*   **Risk Tolerance:**  Liquid investments can range from very safe (e.g., T-Bills) to more risky (e.g., stocks).  Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance.\n",
       "*   **Time Horizon:**  If you have a long time horizon, you can generally tolerate less liquidity in your portfolio.\n",
       "*   **Diversification:**  It's generally a good idea to diversify your investments across different asset classes, including both liquid and illiquid assets.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Liquid financial investments are a crucial part of a well-rounded financial plan. They provide easy access to cash when needed, but it's important to balance liquidity with the potential for higher returns.  Consider your individual circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance when determining the right mix of liquid and illiquid assets for your portfolio.\n",
       "\n",
       "Do you have any specific questions about any of these types of liquid investments, or would you like to explore any of these points in more detail? For example, are you wondering about the liquidity of a specific stock, or how to decide how much of your portfolio should be in liquid assets?\n"

Breakfast at precisely 7:00 AM, a nap on the floral armchair, a demanding meow for dinner at 6:00 PM, followed by chasing dust bunnies until bedtime. It was, in her opinion, a life of purrfect contentment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ignoring her better judgement, she sprang onto the windowsill, testing its stability with a tentative paw. Below, the familiar brick patio dissolved into a riot of green. Hesitantly, she leaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world exploded with new sensations. The rough bark of the oak tree scraping her claws, the earthy smell of damp soil, the dizzying height of the fence. Her comfortable routine had vanished, replaced by a wild, unpredictable tapestry of sights, sounds, and smells.\n",
      "\n",
      "The butterfly, her silent guide, danced just ahead, leading her past the grumpy Mr. Henderson’s rose bushes (she avoided those), through a tangled patch of wildflowers buzzing with bees (she didn't avoid the bees, just swatted at them playfully), and finally, to a place she'd never seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a small, hidden garden tucked behind the old bakery. Sunlight dripped through the leaves, illuminating a miniature waterfall cascading into a shimmering pond. Dragonflies buzzed, frogs croaked, and the air hummed with a symphony of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clementine, mesmerized, forgot about the butterfly. She lapped water from the pond, its taste sweeter than any water from her ceramic bowl. She stalked a particularly plump frog, relishing the thrill of the hunt, even though she had no intention of eating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun began to dip, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a wave of homesickness washed over her. The adventure was exciting, but her floral armchair beckoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the scent of familiar chimneysmoke, Clementine retraced her steps. The grumpy Mr. Henderson glared, but she simply blinked at him with innocent, wide eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back on her windowsill, she hesitated. For a moment, the comfort of her predictable life seemed stifling. But the sunbeam was particularly inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She jumped back inside, rubbing against her human’s legs with extra vigor. Dinner was demanded, dust bunnies were chased, and finally, curled up in her floral armchair, Clementine purred.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But something had changed. The world outside her window no longer seemed so far away. She had tasted adventure, and the memory, like the scent of wildflowers, lingered in her whiskers. Tomorrow, perhaps, she would visit the garden again. After breakfast, of course. A cat, after all, still needed her routines.

       "*   **What it does:**  It modifies your command prompt to display useful Git-related information, such as:\n",
       "    *   The current branch name.\n",
       "    *   Whether the branch is ahead or behind the remote.\n",
       "    *   The status of the working directory (e.g., staged changes, unstaged changes, untracked files, conflicts).\n",
       "    *   Whether you are in a detached HEAD state.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why you'd use it:**\n",
       "    *   **Improved workflow:** At a glance, you can see the state of your Git repository without having to run `git status` every time.\n",
       "    *   **Context awareness:** It helps you stay aware of which branch you're on, which is especially useful when working with multiple branches.\n",
       "    *   **Customization:**  It's highly configurable, allowing you to tailor the prompt to display the information that's most relevant to you, and even customize the colors used.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, it's a productivity booster for anyone who uses Git from the command line.  It provides real-time Git status information directly in your prompt, saving you time and keeping you informed. You'd typically source this script in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to make the changes permanent.\n"
